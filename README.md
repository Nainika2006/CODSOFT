## 📌 Task 3: Iris Flower Classification 🌼

The Iris dataset contains three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — which can be distinguished using sepal and petal measurements.

The objective of this task is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the species of an iris flower based on its features.

### ✔ Key Work
• Feature exploration and visualization  
• Model training using classification algorithms  
• Understanding decision boundaries and model behavior  
• Accuracy evaluation and prediction analysis
